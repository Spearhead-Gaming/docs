# ðŸ—º Mission Planning and Execution

1. While the opinion and perspective of all our members are appreciated, all operations, objectives, patrols, tactics and executions are at the discretion of the HQ element.  The only discussion regarding planning of an operation or execution thereof should happen between the HQ element and the Squad Leaders who will be executing said operation. &#x20;
2. You are welcome to approach any HQ element after you have LEFT the AO to discuss your thoughts.
3. Whatever decision is made will lead to the success or failure of the unit.  We donâ€™t always make the correct decision, but we will always do our best to make the right decision.
4. When you are assigned to a Squad you are expected to follow the commands of your Squad Leader that you are under to the best of your ability.  You are allowed to offer suggestions or advice, but you will follow your orders and not counteract them or issue your own unless you are the 2IC if the SL is indisposed or there is no other command staff available.
