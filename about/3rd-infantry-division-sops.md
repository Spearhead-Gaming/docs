## ALiVE SOP for 3ID

<mark style="color:yellow;">**When conducting an ALiVE deployment the following SOPs must be followed.**</mark>

1. No less than four PAKs (personnel) may conduct an operation(other than logistics in friendly territory) out of the base perimeter at any time. If at any time during an operation you fall below the minimum number, the unit must RTB and fill out the proper After Action Report.
2. You may leave the base up to 100m for defense if under attack with less than four PAKs.
3. A minimum of two PAKs may conduct logistics operations inside friendly areas of operation. &#x20;
4. When leading a patrol of any kind, the organizer of said patrol / team / squad leader must fill out an After Action Report (AAR) in the active-deployment > AARs channel in the Spearhead discord. If you ping Combat Ready you will be expected to lead. There is a pinned format in the AAR channel to use but the AAR must contain the following:
   1. Date/Time
   2. \# of members of each unit in participation
   3. Amount of FKIA/WIA/MIA (friendlies killed, wounded, missing)
   4. Amount of EKIA (including vehicles)
   5. A report of the key points of the mission plan and results. This includes eight digit grid references for any major points of the plan
   6. A picture of your AO on the map and any markings you made
   7. Pictures of POIs, persons of interest, etc are suggested but not required
5. Keep the FOB clean!!!
   1. Put any spare ammo away in crates, bag bodies and place them in the adjacent building to the ammo crate.
6. If you are KIA, you may not requisition a vehicle to return to the AO without a minimum of 4 PAKs and clearing with the patrol leader that you are to do so.
   1. While you may want to get back into the AO as quickly as possible, getting yourself or others killed/losing a vehicle is unacceptable.
7. In vehicle and personal music radios may only be used when not in contact, or under the possibility of contact. Squad lead and above may authorize the use of the music radio. Any abuse of the music radio during operations will result in immediate disciplinary action.
8. In case of contact with local press, all questions should be diverted to Spearhead HQ. If inside or near a combat zone, press should immediately be removed from the area. In the case of a refusal, force up to and including physical detention is authorized. Non-combatants of all kinds must be released after being detained if they do not present an active threat.
9. Those wishing to use Armored vehicles on patrols need to follow all regulations regarding their use (including all required crew slots filled by qualified individuals, and a FULL squad of infantry to support it) and clear their usage with Reaper HQ, a Squad leader, or a member of the Armor Squad (Anvil).

## Unit Expectations

### Professionalism and maturity is expected at all times.

We act in this manner to create a fun and effective environment where the group will not be overwhelmed while in battle. We are the first stop for everyone that joins our Milsim group and your behavior sets the example for <mark style="color:yellow;">**ALL**</mark> members of Spearhead.

1. 3rd Infantry Division is primarily a line based infantry unit.  It is expected you will keep your operational composure.
2. Listen to your command structure. `You` -> `TL` -> `SL` -> `PS` -> `PL`.
3. Operate with efficiency and <mark style="color:yellow;">**without drama**</mark>.
4. Keep radio comms clear of any communications other than information which is immediately pertinent.
5. Keep chatter to a minimum when in the field - keep your head on a swivel - call out only what‚Äôs necessary & retain the initiative against the enemy.

### Communication

1. It is <mark style="color:yellow;">**vitally**</mark> important that we observe silence when we are in the ‚ÄúArea of Operation‚Äù or ‚ÄúAO‚Äù. Remember that you MUST be on PTT (Push to Talk) for all communications; not only over radio, but also local voice.
   1. Outside of the AO; you are free to communicate freely on local voice, filter free.  You can BS, joke, hang out, whatever. There is no harm in speaking freely outside of the AO.
2. Inside of the AO; we are comms-restricted for local voice. It is expected that you keep all communication mission specific and put yourself on whisper (use your squad net if your team is outside whisper range) because <mark style="color:yellow;">**the enemy can hear you**</mark>.

### Mission Planning and Execution

1. While the opinion and perspective of all of our members are appreciated, all operations, objectives, patrols, tactics and executions are at the discretion of the HQ element. The only discussion regarding planning of an operation or execution thereof should happen between the HQ element and the Squad Leaders who will be executing said operation. &#x20;
   1. You are welcome to approach any HQ element AFTER the mission to discuss your thoughts.
   2. Whatever decision is made will lead to the success or failure of the unit.  We don‚Äôt always make the correct decision, but we will always do our best to make the right decision.
   3. When you are assigned to a Squad you are expected to follow the commands of your Squad Leader that you are under to the best of your ability. You are allowed to offer suggestions or advice but you will follow your orders and not counteract them or issue your own unless you are the 2IC in the event that the SL is indisposed or there is no other command staff available.

### Squad Leaders

1. Squad leaders are assigned by the HQ element of 3ID.
   1. During operations, Squad Leaders will execute the operation put forward by HQ. &#x20;
   2. All SOPs previously mentioned regarding Mission Planning and Execution still apply to Squad Leaders. You may not without good reason (such as immediate risk of death) disobey an order from HQ. Suggestions are welcome during the planning/operational phase but will not be welcome after. Please work with your CoC outside of the AO if you would like to participate in the planning of the operation. &#x20;
   3. Outside of operations, Squad Leaders are leaders for 3ID in general and may assist with training and other specialized objectives given by HQ.

### Mandatory Play Time

1. You <mark style="color:yellow;">**must**</mark> remain in 3ID for a minimum of <mark style="color:yellow;">**30 days**</mark> before departing to another unit. We do this so that you understand how the group works, and we get to know you prior to you attempting to go do something else. While not mandatory, we offer an introductory course (ITC) which everyone is expected to attend when possible. &#x20;
   1. Prior service waives this 30-day minimum, however it is still up to the CO‚Äôs discretion whether or not you may transfer. &#x20;
   2. Service <mark style="color:yellow;">**must**</mark> be verified by a Spearhead Staff member. &#x20;
2. We also highly encourage you to stay in 3ID! We have lots of leadership and specialist training opportunities.

### Culture

3ID prides itself in being a low-drama unit. **There is a&#x20;**<mark style="color:yellow;">**0-tolerance**</mark>**&#x20;policy** for petty or insignificant drama. This is not a democracy, and it never will be. To make this abundantly clear; do not disparage or otherwise denigrate other units. You will be immediately removed.
