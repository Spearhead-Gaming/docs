# âœˆ Deployment Server SOP's

1. No less than four PAKs (personnel) may conduct an operation out of the base perimeter at any time.  If at any time during an operation you fall below the minimum number, the unit must RTB and fill out the proper After-Action Report.
2. You may leave the base up to 100m for defense if under attack with four PAKs.
3. A minimum of TWO PAKs may conduct logistics operations inside friendly areas of operation. Moving personnel from base to friendly forces in the field is considered logistics. One person may leave friendly forces in the field to collect other personnel at base.
4. When leading a patrol of any kind, the organizer of said patrol / team / squad leader must fill out an After-Action Report (AAR) in the #operation-after-action channel in discord.  The AAR must contain the following:
   * Date/Time
   * Members Involved
   * Amount of FKIA/WIA/MIA.
   * Amount of EKIA (including vehicles)
   * A detailed report of the mission plan and results.  This includes eight-digit grid references for any major points of the plan.
   * Pictures of AO are suggested but not required.

   * Put any spare ammo away in crates, bag bodies and place them in the adjacent building to the ammo crate.

6. If you are KIA, you may not requisition a vehicle to return to the AO without a minimum of 4 PAKs and clearing with leadership that you are to do so.
