The 75th  Ranger regiment prides itself on being a low-drama unit.  We will not tolerate any bullying of other players, inside or outside of the unit. We will respect other players in this community and should not accept anyone that does so.

There will be no talking bad about other units or commenting on their failures.&#x20;
