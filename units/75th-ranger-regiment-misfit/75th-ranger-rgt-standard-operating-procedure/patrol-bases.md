# 🏘 Patrol Base's

1. When patrol bases are available in deployments, the PL or PS must be present to approve and build a patrol base.&#x20;
2. Patrols bases must be located within the LOA
3. Multiple patrols should be conducted through the area to ensure that the area is secure.
4. Patrol leaders can recommend locations that may be appropriate for a PB but PL/PS have final say on location.
5. Once a PB is established, PAK can spawn and use the PB as a starting point for their patrol or operation.&#x20;
6. Patrol bases will have a minimal footprint and should have only the bare minimum to sustain it.
7. If supplies are running low at a patrol base, the patrol leader should include it in the AAR and should be replenished as the next possible opportunity.
8. If a patrol base has been compromised, the patrol leader should report that it in the AAR and that PB will no longer be used.
