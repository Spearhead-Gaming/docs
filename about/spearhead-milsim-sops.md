   1. Do NOT mix ORBAT roles
   2. All equipment, vehicles, and assets must be used appropriately and accounted for.
   3. Reckless use of any asset will either delete our stock or require corrective action.
   4. The active ground commander is responsible for all aspects of their mission on land, sea, and air, and must incorporate all active units within their operations accordingly.  The TF Commander at the time retains OPCON of all units, but tactical Control remains in the hands of the sub-unit Commanders (i.e. tell a unit what to hit, not how to hit it).
   5. Aviation may slot in as a basic rifleman under 3ID to prevent burnout of pilots, but may not lead patrols.
4. It is expected that all friendly vehicles utilized in combat operations be returned to their original staging areas assuming they are still operational.
   1. If they are not operational, recover the vehicle and repair it.

   3. If you are unable to recover the vehicle, destroy it.

6. Enemy weapons and vehicles are not permitted for use.
   1. Exception: Should you run out of ammo or have no transportation, have no feasible resupply from friendlies AND there is an immediate danger to life you are permitted to defend yourself at all times. At the EARLIEST opportunity you are to switch back to your primary weapon and must retain your primary weapon at all times. You must demo/destroy enemy vehicles stolen for exfil.
7. Team killing, executing civilians, or fabricating scenarios to inflict damage are punishable by lengthy bans and on rare occasions, executions.
   1. If a mission is designed where a civilian populace could potentially be turned, a separate notice will be issued to define the ROE.
8. Horseplay, derping, firing weapons at base (including handguns, rifles, crew-served weapons, smoke grenades, and flares, while not engaged in defensive operations) are not permitted and will be punished by removal from the Spearhead Gaming servers, up to and including removal from the community entirely.
9. In Spearhead, there are two different qualifications that allow individuals to coordinate fire support: Joint Fires Observers (JFOs) and Joint Terminal Attack Controllers (JTACs)
   1. JFO is an entry-level qualification to allow for any qualified individual to call for and coordinate HLZs, mortar fire support and request for simple close air support when necessary.
   2. JTAC is an advanced-level qualification that will allow individuals to call in fire support from CAS aircraft and artillery, deconflict airspace, as well as hold terminal attack control for all CAS strikes.
   3. JTAC training will consist of a two-part training session where individuals must pass evaluations to be qualified.
      1. Only those who have passed evaluations and received their JTAC qualification may slot in the JTAC role for their unit.
   4. All present JTACs (1 per unit for max. of 3) will coordinate with each other on 32.8 to manage CAS assets and deconflict aircraft.
   5. If Fires Net is busy with radio traffic, frequencies 33.8/34.8/35.8 may be utilized by JTACs and pilots for further coordination.
   6. Approved weapons are designated by the MIL-SIM HQ.
      1. Where possible, JTACs should always adhere to carrying semi/semi-automatic weapon systems with some form of underslung grenade launcher for marking purposes.
      2. Accessories such as all laser/light combos, alongside bipods/foregrips are authorized as per MIL-SIM HQ.
      3.  DMRs, AT and LMG/HMGs should not be carried. A JTACâ€™s most effective weapon is their radio, their primary role is to coordinate and provide fire support for their unit. Taking

          on other weapon roles will detract from this.
   7. JTACs are authorized to call for fire utilizing indirect fire assets larger than a mortar system. Those authorized to conduct and coordinate those strikes will do a proper collateral damage estimate to minimize effects on civilian infrastructure and personnel.
      1. All artillery fire missions will be conducted on 31.8.
10. Only authorized personnel who have completed the required qualification course will be authorized to use Long-Range Rifles or Marksman Rifles.

A Marksman Rifle is classified as a scoped high-precision rifle chambered in 5.56x45mm or 7.62x51mm (exceptions may apply) with an optic of 8x Magnification and below, and a typical engagement range between 300 and 600 Meters. This weapon system can be found in bolt-action and semi-automatic configurations.  This rifle is for designated marksman (DM) only.  The DM is a UNIT-level asset.
    3. The DM is in addition to a unit level asset, meaning that it should not be used unless a unit has a specific need for it.  Unit XO/CO may revise as needed.
    4. A Long-Range Rifle (Sniper) is classified as a scoped high-precision rifle chambered in 7.62x51mm or larger (exceptions may apply) with an optic of 4x Magnification and above, and a typical engagement range beyond 600 Meters.

    7. Spotters must be Sniper qualified but are not allowed to carry either Marksman Rifles or Long-Range Rifles while in the Spotter slot.
    8. Unit Commanders can authorize individual members under their command to utilize the Vector and Range Finders as they deem necessary, and it is the Unit Commanderâ€™s responsibility to police those assets.
    9. Designated Marksman qualifications will be conducted through unit level instruction. The instructor should communicate pass/fail status on attendees to the SHG XO/CO.
    10. Long-Range Rifle (Sniper) qualification will be a much more in-depth class to be taught by either a member of Spearhead Command or a designated member of the Mentor team.
    11. Obtaining this qualification does not mean the use of Long-Range Rifles will be permitted. The availability of Long-Range Rifles will depend on many factors including unit, deployment, and mission objective.
    12. Unit Commanders must determine who will fill Sniper/Spotter roles for a said deployment. The roles will not be mixed or changed mid deployment without approval of SHG CO/XO.
    13. SHG CO/XO/CSM reserves the right to revoke these qualifications at any time, for any reason. Unit Commanders reserve the right to revoke SDM qualifications internal to their unit.

All bans that are longer than 3-days are only to be issued by MIL-SIM CO/XO.

    2. Do not make additions or subtractions to the fortifications without prior approval of your CoC. The only exception is in case of emergencies or if existing fortifications have been destroyed.

    2. Marksman: You may only slot as a marksman if you have passed the level I marksman course. The marksman is IN ADDITION to a unit asset, meaning you should be able to field your units prior to changing any weapons systems to a marksman platform within that squad. Unit leadership may amend this to the mission set.
    3. EOD: You may only slot as EOD if you can show to your unit leadership that you understand how to; locate, identify, disable and destroy mines/IEDs. Identify all types of- explosives utilized by the taskforce and their trigger systems.

This role should only be used if the mission necessitates. (edited)
