# 📞 Communication

1. It is vitally important that we observe silence when we are in the “Area of Operation” or “AO”.  Per Spearhead SOP’s, it is required to use a PTT or Push to Talk comms.  Inside of the AO, we are comms restricted to PTT comms.  It is expected that you place yourself on whisper and use net comms with your team in the AO.  Remember that the enemy can hear you and will react to your voice.
2. Outside of the AO; you are free to communicate freely on PTT comms. There is no harm in speaking freely outside of the AO.&#x20;
3. During Task Force briefing/debriefing keep talking to a minimum. The only time that you should be talking is when you are constructively adding to the conversation.
