# ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² Unit Expectations

* Professionalism and maturity are always expected.  We act in this manner to create a fun and effective environment where the group will not be overwhelmed while in battle.&#x20;
* Listen to your command structure.  `You` -> `TL` -> `SL` -> `PS` -> `PL`.&#x20;
* If there is any issue, utilize the proper chain of command. If the issue is with your immediate superior or your do not feel that they have handled the issue correctly, go to the next person in your chain.&#x20;
* Operate with efficiency and without drama.
* Keep radio comms clear the second you are called to do so. If you donâ€™t need to be on the radio at that time, donâ€™t be!
* Keep chatter to a minimum when in the field - keep your head on a swivel - call out only whatâ€™s necessary & retain the initiative against the enemy.
* The level of intoxication will be monitored by unit leadership. If an individualâ€™s intoxication reaches a point where leadership has to step in, that individual will be removed from the operation or patrol and will receive a 24-hour ban. If the actions continue, that individual could possibly be removed from the unit.&#x20;
  * Understanding that most of the unit contains adults, we understand that you may want to drink while playing. But there is a difference between having a few drinks to relax and being completely drunk.
